# The Sentinel Project
## Note: 
- You are going to need Python 3.6+ in order to run these scripts.

## Usage:
- You can run any of these scripts independently from your terminal, but, if you want to interact with them in a different way, just execute the console.py script and it is going to start a custom console called "Sentinella" ...
