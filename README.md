# The Sentinel Project
## Notes: 
- You are going to need Python 3.6+ in order to run these scripts.
- The console.py script is still very buggy and needs more work, if you don't feel comfortable in using it, run the scripts from your terminal, by the classic way.

## Usage:
- You can run any of these scripts independently from your terminal, but, if you want to interact with them in a different way, just execute the console.py script and it is going to start a custom console called "Sentinella" ...
